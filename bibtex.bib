abstract="Recent research in mobile robots is concerned with sensor based navigation. In this problem the robot starts with no apriori information about the environment, and must use its sensors to perceive the environment and plan a collision-free path to a target configuration. Algorithms for this problem are classified into local and global planners. Local sensor-based planners strive to be reactive, while still guaranteeing convergence to the target. We describe a local planner called TangentBug, which uses local range data to navigate two degrees-of-freedom mobile robots. In contrast, global sensor-based planners incrementally construct a global model of the environment, and use this model for path planning. We describe a global planner called IRoadmap, which constructs a roadmap based on range data encoded as a repulsive potential field. The algorithm uses two novel abstract sensors: a critical point detector and a minimum passage detector, and we show by examples how to implement these detectors for the navigation of three degrees-of-freedom mobile robots.",

abstract="This paper presents an approach for depth sensor based detection of target objects and automated generation of trajectories for a robot-aided object scanning process. In general quality management concerning purchased or manufactured products is of central importance. Inspection and verification processes can be very time consuming or require high personnel expenditures which encourages the utilization of automated quality assessment methods. The presented strategy combines the detection of known objects inside the workspace of a robot based on an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm with trajectory planning and G code generation. For this purpose the workspace around the target object is divided into sub-volumes to identify a set of 3D support points that are the basis of the final scanning path. This method shows promising results in simulation as well as in first tests on a real system.",
