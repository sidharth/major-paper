\section{Future Work}

The heuristic could be further improved by adding penalties for changes in direction as currently, a lot of energy of the agent is involved in continuously checking other directions for a marginally better path.

The long term path planning algorithm is not effective with complex maze patterns. The inability of the agent to have awareness about large obstacles like walls leads to inefficient path planning. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using the depth map can be performed, in order to obtain better relative performance and more awareness about the surroundings.
