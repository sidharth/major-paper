Synthetic data has a successful history in computer vision. Taylor et al.
present a system called ObjectVideo Virtual Video (OVVV) ~\cite{Taylor_2007} based on Half-life for evaluation of tracking in surveillance systems. 
 
In the recent literature, a variety of methods use 3D CAD models with simple rendering to tackle vision problems. Peng et al. , and Sun and Saenko use non-photorealistic 3d CAD models to improve object detection. Lim et al. , and Aubry et al. use CAD models for detection and object alignment in the image. Aubry and Russell use synthetic RGB images rendered from CAD models to analyze the response pattern and the behavior of neurons in the commonly used deep convolutional networks.
