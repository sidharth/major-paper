Usage of a single camera in autonomous aerial vehicles makes it tough to make the
correct near-future decision in order to correctly navigate the vehicle and avoid
collision.
 
On the other hand, depth cameras are bulky and not suited for the mobile requirements of lightweight autonomous vehicles. Hence a middle ground is required which requires depth calculation from limited available input.
 
We present an approach for depth map estimation using stereoscopic images - a vital intermediate technique for autonomous navigation and pathfinding. We also propose a path planner interfaced with the depth map for locally planning a sequence of steps to the desired location.
