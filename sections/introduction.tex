\section{Introduction}
The path planning problem for mobile robots can be defined as the search for a path which a robot (with specified geometry) has to follow in a described environment, in order to reach a particular position and orientation B, given an initial position and orientation. ~\cite{Liu_2015_CVPR} 

In the past year, neural network based models have shown remarkable results ~\cite{Liu_2015_CVPR}

Truly autonomous aerial vehicles have various applications in security, surveillance, transportation and accessibility. So far, usage of these autonomous vehicles has been restricted. 

This paper describes an approach for an agent to navigate from source co-ordinates to destination co-ordinates while avoiding obstacles that may appear on it's path. Through this project, we introduce an autonomous control policy to govern aerial agents.
